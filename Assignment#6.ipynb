    "## Define Object Oriented Programming Language? \n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. In this way, the data structure becomes an object that includes both data and functions. In addition, programmers can create relationships between one object and another. For example, objects can inherit characteristics from other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the most effective approach to writing software. In this we can write class that represent real world things and situations and we create objects based on these classes.\n"

    "-\tObject-oriented programming fosters reusability. A computer program is written in the form of objects and classes, which can be reused in other projects as well.\n",
    "-\tThe modular approach used in object-oriented programming results in highly maintainable code.\n",
    "-\tIn object-oriented programming, every class has a specific task. If an error occurs in one part of the code, you can rectify it locally without having to affect other parts of the code.\n",

    "1.\tA method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
